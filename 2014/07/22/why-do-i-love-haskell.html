    <h1>Why do I love Haskell more than Ruby?</h1>

    <p>When I started to learn Ruby, I was excited. It was so great and so
easy! The code was readable almost as English and the language allowed
me to do everything I wanted. Well, Rails was a bit magical for me, but
it was also a very effective. Maybe I did not exactly know why, but it
worked and I was able to build an application. </p>

<p>Here am I, two years later, and I still love doing in Ruby. I have a job
as a Rails developer, I am learning it in my University &hellip; It is
basically all I know, but&hellip;I slowly start to feel the downsides of this
freedom I was so excited about. And I realize it even more and more as I
am learning functional programming with Haskell.</p>

<p>I just finished the notorious <strong>Learn You a Haskell for a Great Good</strong> book,
which I got from my boyfriend. First, I read it just because I was
curious but then I realized that I really love what I am reading. It was
not like learning Ruby at all, it was like learning how to program all
over again! I discovered that nothing what I already knew will help me,
but it was OK, I was doing it for fun. Then I discovered that there is a
certain security, which everyone is talking about and which is actually
pretty awesome. Then I discovered math in Haskell and I started to
understand it much better, and lastly I discovered how beautifully everything goes together. But
step by step.</p>

<h2>Haskell is not like any other programming language, or at least not like Ruby.</h2>

<p>Haskell syntax is very simple. I do not understand why would anyone say
something else. There are just functions which given the same input
always return the same output. You can also put function as an argument
and get another one as a result!</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight haskell"><code><span class="n">factorial</span> <span class="o">::</span> <span class="kt">Integer</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="kt">Integer</span>
<span class="n">factorial</span> <span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">product</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">..</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>You see? Nothing tricky about the syntax! Function name and parametres
at one side, the implementation on other.. The first line represents type
signature, we will speak more about types in a while.</p>

<p>Haskell is lazy, which means that a function argument will not get
evaluated until it has to be. This allows us to work with infinite
lists, which I think is really cool :) Now you can start to see how
different Haskell is from Ruby, but it may not be clear why are these
things good. Lets continue.</p>

<p>Haskell uses pattern matching. In your function, you can implement it
several times for different patterns and the one which will match will
be called.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight haskell"><code><span class="n">reverse</span> <span class="o">::</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="n">reverse</span> <span class="kt">[]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kt">[]</span>
<span class="n">reverse</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="n">xs</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">reverse</span> <span class="n">xs</span> <span class="o">++</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This example is so elegant! If we put an empty list into this function,
the result is also empty list. That is our first pattern. The second
pattern says, if we put anything else, we can see it as X and XS, he head
and the rest. First element and the other elements. The implementation
is than calling recursively the same function but only for the rest -<code>xs</code>
and putting the first element to the end of the results. </p>

<p>It is very common in Haskell to treat every possible situation which can
occur. It is similar as in Ruby checking if what we got into a
function is not an accidental nil, but is more powerful because Haskell
will actually tell you if you are not matching all the possible
patterns.</p>

<p>One more thing I want to share with you. What happens, when you put 1
argument into a function that takes 2? Well, error? Not in Haskell! You
will get a whole new function, which will take the missing argument and
only then produce the result.</p>

<h2>Safety with types</h2>

<p>Yes, Haskell is lazy, it is pure and it has cool pattern matching but
the biggest difference from Ruby and the thing I love the most is its
type system. It is statically typed, so all the types of your
functions and arguments are checked before it is compiled. If the
compilation succeeds, your code is most probably correct! What a nice
feature to have, I wish someone would tell me if my Ruby code is correct
the same way &hellip; </p>

<p>Well, someone could say, that to type the types on every variables and
every function is tedious and can get you in the way. But not in
Haskell! You do not have to explicitly write the types, the compiler
can reason about them. Which is nice because it can also tell you when
you are not sure. </p>

<p>The best of all is making your own type classes though. Have you ever
made a function in Ruby which was expecting for example an User ID but
you accidentally send an Report ID instead and was wondering what went
wrong? With Haskell you could do a type just for User ID and check if it
is passed in. Integers are not all the same!</p>

<p>You can make type classes which supports some behaviour and then
concrete instances of these classes. For example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight haskell"><code><span class="kr">class</span> <span class="kt">Eq</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="kr">where</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">==</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">::</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="kt">Bool</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">/=</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">::</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="kt">Bool</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Here Eq is a class for things that can be compared if they are equal.
Lots of things can do that, so the instances of this class could be
Integers, Strings, etc &hellip; The function type declaration says that for
equal (==), it takes two things of the same type <code>a</code> and
return a <code>Bool</code> - true or false. For not equal it is the same. </p>

<p>Type system gives you safety and expresivness - you can build your own
types in a several ways, you can just give aliases to existing types,
like name instead of string, or you can create a completely new types,
like Person type. </p>

<h2>Math in Haskell</h2>

<p>In ruby, there is no science involved. The closest I get to a science was
implementing a sorting algoritm in Ruby, but that can be done in any
language. Haskell, on the other hand, feels like science from the
beginning. You can find math there, which gives you a feeling of
importance and correctness. </p>

<p>If you look at functions, you can already see that they resembles a
classical functions much more then those in Ruby. They are pure, this
means that they do not have any side effects. There is of course a
possibility to do side effects in Haskell, but the important is that it
is always separate from the rest. </p>

<p>If you take a look at some of the most common type classes, Functors,
Monoids, Applicatives, Monads.. You would see even more math there! You
know that Monoid needs to have an associative binary operation and a
neutral element. When we put this element as a one argument to this operation, the result of the operation will be the same as the second argument. On another words, the second argument will not change. </p>

<p>For integers, you can make two instances of Monoids, because these rules
supports both addition as product. <code>Mempty</code> represents this neutral
element, <code>&lt;&gt;</code> represents the operation and it is called <code>mappend</code>.
Check it out:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight haskell"><code><span class="kr">instance</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">Num</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="kt">Monoid</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">Product</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="kr">where</span>
    <span class="n">mempty</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kt">Product</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">Product</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">&lt;&gt;</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">Product</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kt">Product</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="kr">instance</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">Num</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="kt">Monoid</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">Sum</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="kr">where</span>
    <span class="n">mempty</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kt">Sum</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">Sum</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">&lt;&gt;</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">Sum</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kt">Sum</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>If you had done at least some undergraduate math, you should understand these
laws as well as others. At least for me everything started to make sense
when I realized the connections..Its just like group axioms!</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Haskell is very different, many would say that it is hard to learn or
that its syntax is not friendly. I disagree. Learning Haskell is in a
way much easier than learning Ruby, just because there are boundries and
walls which you must obey. Too much freedom is demanding, one
must think all the time about possible outcomes, about hundreds of
possible ways how to implement something. In Haskell, if you take a look
at the type signatires, you often know the implementation right away,
because there is just one way how to do it. For beginners, it is much
clearer and easier, not to mention the amazing type system which gives
you all the power. Anyway, I just love Haskell!</p>
