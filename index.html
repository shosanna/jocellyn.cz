  <p>There are two main strategies when it comes to evaluation of en expression, regardless of programming language.
This article explains the difference using Haskell and then discusses it with comparison to Ruby.</p>

<p>Lets start with a very simple example: </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight haskell"><code>  <span class="n">sqrt</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This function counts a square root of an expression <code>2+4</code>. It can do it in two ways:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight haskell"><code><span class="c1">-- 1. variant</span>
<span class="n">sqrt</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="mi">4</span>
<span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">6</span>
<span class="o">=</span> <span class="kr">let</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">6</span> <span class="kr">in</span></code></pre></div>
