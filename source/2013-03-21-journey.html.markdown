I would like to introduce you my new app called Journey.

Journey is your place to self-improvement through daily tasks, which will require you to think about yourself and your life in a way that you are not used to.

By improving yourself and growing you get most of your life. There are many ways in which you can do that. Following a daily tasks of thinking and writing is one of them, keeping a diary or meditation could be another one.

Any kind of self-improvement is good when it is forcing you to step out of your comfort zone and face new challenges. The reward for doing this will be gaining new perspectives. It is your awareness and attitude which will lead you to a better you.

 Try journey, spend a few minutes daily with a simple tasks and you will become more aware of your emotions, attitudes and perspectives.

I believe that self-improvement is for everyone and that by your own forces you can do whatever you want to do.
