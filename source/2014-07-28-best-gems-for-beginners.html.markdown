Ruby Gems are essential for every Ruby on Rails programmer. They
are a small pieces of already writen and tested code which provide some
functionality. For example, there
are many gems which provide administrative interface for your app. It
means that you instal the gem, make some basic setup and you are all
set to use the administrative section. You can manage your
resources there. This of
course doesn't mean that you can not write exactly the same thing on
your own. You can create admin namespace, controllers and manualy
prepare all the views for each of your models. This is not a hard job,
for sure, but it can be quite boring and time consuming, as you would
need to repeat the same steps over and over again. Not just in one app
for several resources but across your apps which needs such a
functionality as the admin section is usually always same. The whole beauty of gems
is that they will save your time by providing common and well know
solutions. 

The downside is that there are plenty of them. Because they solve
popular problems, many people think their solution is the best, so they
create gems. I
gathered the most popular ones so that you can know what to look for
when you will need it. I took in account beginner's friendly gems, those
which you would probably need in a fairly simple applications. Before we
proceed to this list, I want to make a quick recommendation - take a
look at all the gems which are over there at the official site
[rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org/) or compare how each of the gems is
used at [ruby-toolbox](https://www.ruby-toolbox.com).

## List of useful gems and when to use them

## Devise
Devise deserves to get to the top of my list as it is the absolutely
must have solution for quick login / logout / sign up functionality. You
use devise when you want to add sessions for your users, so that they
can authenticate themself with a password and log into their account. After
adding it to your web app, it generates the controllers which handle the
sessions and the basic views for login page (as well as registration page,
have you lost your password page, etc..).You also get handy helpers as for example
"current_user", which you can use in your controller to test if the
visitor is logged or in views to display his name... It is also good when you does not
want to deal with security stuff (encrypting the users' passwords) as it
is doing it for you. 

Everything and much more is very deeply described at [Devise Github
page](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise), but do not forget to
check also their [wiki](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/wiki).
One last advantage of devise - because it is so widespread and everyone
is using it, when you run into some problems and google it, you will
find a lots of answers.If you wish to explore the other options, [this
article](http://everydayrails.com/2011/09/21/rails-authentication.html)
sums it up.

**Use when: you want to have users authentication on your page. Period.**

## Simple Form
By default rails uses the form_tag or form_for for generating forms. That's ok but
with Simple Form your life could be so much easier. Simple form is a gem
which provides a different and more intuitive way of creating forms. It
will generate whole html input with labes, error fields and hints for
you and you just need to specify the fields which should be updated. It
supports collections (so that your users can pick a value from a list)
or associations (so that in one model you can updated also the associated
fields). The best about simple_form is that you just type "form_for
@user" and specify the fields, the submit button and you are ready to
go. It is unbeliavebely quick. The gem is to be found
[here](https://github.com/plataformatec/simple_form).

**Use when: you want to handle your form easily and in the same fashion
through the entire app.**

## Bootstrap
Bootstrap is a frontend framework, it is the set of prepared CSS styles
and javascripts behaviours which anyone can use and customize on their
web pages. You should to take a look at the documentation of
[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) because their site is just
amazing. You can just browse the examples and if you like something, you
can copy the code right away. Bootstrap is very elegant and clean way
how to give your page a professional and neat feeling without any actual
designers work. It will for example take care of your forms, make them
pretty aligned and spaced, it will give your buttons more appealing
look, it will make your tables lesss crowded or it can completely build
the navbar for you. There are several another complex components, there
are also icons which you can use, the grid system for your layouts and
javascript tweaks like dropdown menus and much more. The gem for Rails
provides access to all of it.

Of course, you do not have to use the gem, you can just download the
source codes from their official page and link them in your application.
Using gem hovewer is a better solution, as it is much faster and easier
 and it also will get updated for you whenever you will run
bundle update. There is also a third option, which I do not encourage
because it depends on constant internet connection. This is to use the
CDN links. CDN stands for content delivery network and it is a service
which provides only the links (not the actual code) to for example bootstrap. You
can use these links and use bootstrap the same as if you would have
downloaded it. As I said, you need to be online to be able to constantly
reach the content provided elsewhere, which is not
exactly good when developing locally without internet (you would lost
big part of your design). 

So without more talking here is the
[gem](https://github.com/seyhunak/twitter-bootstrap-rails).

Last comment on Bootstrap - if you are afraid you would just be "the
same" as any other webpage using it, don't be. Bootstrap is just a
starting point, it is not your whole design. It is supposed to be
customized and altered. In many pages you would not even tell that it is
using bootstrap. You can apply your CSS or you can even rewrite theirs,
it is completely up to you. Bootstrap is there taking care of the little
things so that you can put all your energy into the big tasks.

Why to bother with grid system and make columns
and rows when bootstrap has one class for it?
If you are fan of frontend framworks, there is one more which is fairly
popular and intereseting, it is called [Zurb Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/).

**Use when: you want your app to look good with minimum effort, you need a grid system or
you are just not good with CSS**

## Rspec + Factory Girl
Rspec is a testing framework which makes your testing a pleasure instead of a pain. It is very intuitive to use and to
organize your code into logical blocks. You can writte stuff like `user.proejects.last.should be_nil` or `user.projects.count.should_not eql(0)`.
Also, to test your controllers became very easy - you can make request just like this: `get :index` and compare what cames back `response.should be_success`.
in short - it is readable as English! Rspec documentation is [here](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails).

The real beauty is FactoryGirl, which is for fixture replacements. What is it? Well, imagine you want to create objects in your test, but you do not want to
repeat all over again all the neccessary attributes when creating it. With FactoryGirl, you can just define all your models objects and how to create these in one place and then in all your tests let FactoryGirl to generate objects based on these premade blueprints. The gem can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl_rails) but there is not so much documentation. You can take a look at this [article](http://www.hiringthing.com/2012/08/17/rails-testing-factory-girl.html#sthash.8ZIL68s5.dpbs).

**Use when: you want better testing environment and you want to enjoy writting tests!**

## CanCan
We spoke a bit about devise, which gives your web app the authentication
system. Cancan is next on turn, because it extends it on authorization. With
cancan you can have several roles applied to different users or groups
and each role can have different rights as you specify. For example, only
redactors can delete posts or only admin can view the admin section or
edit user's details. The system of roles and rights is up to you, Cancan
is just making it easy to achieve. It also have a nice helpers so that
you can instantly know if the current user has the rights for certain
action or not. If you only need an admin role, you can create it easily
on your own, but CanCan is ready for multiple types of authorizations
and for more complex behaviours.

 The page for the gem is
[here](https://github.com/ryanb/cancan). For Rails 4, use newer version called [CanCanCan](https://github.com/CanCanCommunity/cancancan).

**Use when: you want to have users authorization and you plan to have
more complex access logic than just "admin can do all".**


## Act as taggable on
I Love this simple gem! You just add one line of a code into your model which you wish to have tags, and ....bum! You have tag behaviour :) It is good when 
you want one object to have one or zero or multiple tags and you want to filter based on that or display it. The tags themselves are just plane names without any more information, but can serve well for categorization.
You can add taggs to a object, view all its tags, search the entire model for records with specific tags, and so on. It doesn't even have to be tag, you can define your own attributes with similar behaviour but different name, like for example skills. take a look at the example from the [gem page](https://github.com/mbleigh/acts-as-taggable-on).

```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  acts_as_taggable 
end

@user.tag_list.add("awesome", "slick")
@user.tag_list.remove("awesome", "slick")
```
**Use when: you want to support tags or tag-like behaviour with ease - for example books can have categories, people can have skills, discussion topics can have themes...**

## Rolify
Rolify enables you to add .... what a surrprise - a role to your models! It plays well with `CanCan` because you can add a role like `admin` or `manager` to certain users and then you can manage their accession rights via `CanCan`. Rolify with help you only with the assignemnts of role. You can make it very simply by yourself with just adding a boolean attribute to your model, with the same name as the required role - admin for example. To set an user a admin, you would just do `user.admin = true`. But Rolify will give you much more than that. You can have multiple roles without adding a new attributes for them, you can easily check if someone has that role and you can also search all the records with a given role. It is quite similar to previously disscussed Act as taggable on, but for a different purpose. Check it out [here](https://github.com/RolifyCommunity/rolify).

**User when: you want multiple to have roles for your model so that you can for example build your athorization on them**

## Carrierwave
Carrierwave is used for image uploading. It iss very simple and quick, but I will not explain it here as there are several great tutorials for it out there. You can check [this article](http://www.sitepoint.com/processing-images-with-carrierwave/) or [this one](https://blog.engineyard.com/2011/a-gentle-introduction-to-carrierwave) or continue directly to a [CarrierWave page](https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave).

**Use when: you want your users to have a possibility to upload images - for example as their profile pictures**

## Better Errors + Pry
I am not sure if this is fit for beginners, but I love it so I will just briefly recommend it. Better errors enables a very smart error page instead of the default one which is not telling you much. With better errors, you got a instant acces to REPL whenever there is an error in your app - it is very useful for debugging. You can find it [here](https://github.com/charliesome/better_errors). 

Pry is even better, it gives you a possibility to set a place in your code, where you want to stop to debug and open a REPL in that place. You can gain an insight into what is happening within your code at that exact momnent you need it. It is very very handy and it also have syntax highlighting! Here [it is](http://pryrepl.org/).

**Use when: if you ever wrote something like `puts 'here it still works!'` - forget puts statements it and debug like a pro!**

## Act as indexed
[Act as indexed](https://github.com/dougal/acts_as_indexed) is pain-free way how to add a full-text search into your app. 

**Use when: you want a quick way how to search through multiple fields in a model**

## Active Admin 
Is used to add en entire admin section to your page - with management of your resources. If you want to for example view all records, delete selected ones, add new ones and alter existing ones and you need to do it for several resources, it is just for you. It will build the entire interface for you. Here is its [official page](http://activeadmin.info/).

**Use when: you want complex solution for admin section - you want to manage multiple models at one place**

## Party Boy
Allows you to model relationships between models - add friends, follow users, block users, etc.. With party boy it is easy to just write `user.follow(user2)` to start a following relationship or to check for existing ones via `user.followers`. You can use it for creating facebook - like friends and permission to see their statuses, to implement notification about your friends activity and much more. It just does what it supposes to do. [here is its Github](https://github.com/mnelson/party_boy)

**Use when: you want your users to be friends or followers :)**

## Will paginate
Have you ever have a index of all records with more than 100 records in it? [Here!](https://github.com/mislav/will_paginate), Will paginate will fix it with simple pagination option.

**Use when: you want to add multiple pages into index and have the possibility to paginate them**

## Public Activity
Will add a feed of notifications to your app! You can combine it nicely with `Party Boy` to display news within a user's friends just like a Facebook or Twitter notification bar. It has very nice [documentation](https://github.com/pokonski/public_activity) with a guide and lots of examples so I encourage you to study it there. 

**Use when: you want to record what is happening in your app and give your users these information as a news feed**
