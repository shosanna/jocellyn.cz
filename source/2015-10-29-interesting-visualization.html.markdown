What is an interesting vizualization? for me, it is this [you draw it](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/05/28/upshot/you-draw-it-how-family-income-affects-childrens-college-chances.html) project.
It is not the resulting line chart what would be so stunning, that is fairly standard:

It is the interactivity which is really amazing. Yoy can see it all over - today's visualizations are full of interacitivty - you can hover over the bar chart to see the labels,
you can click few buttons to switch the data beying presented to see the comparison, etc. But this is a whole new level according to my opinion.

The reader is firstly prompt to draw his own data representation! Of course there is a little help and a written explanation on how to do it. The resulting chart is then composed 
from real data and you input - that is very new, the reader is becoming a co-author. The chart is also getting a new dimension. It is no longer just a story about "how growing up in a rich/poor family affects the likelihood of going to college".
Now it is a story about how the ordinary person - like you - view this issue and how it is shifted from the reality.

And because 1 person is not a representative sample, you are giving a second chart - with summary of all the people who participated:

Which is in turn also a nice graphics - the shades under the curves represents how common that a swer was. This is very well choosen as the density of the pink shades serves good in telling about the density of the answers - almost transparent to white means no one has choosen this place.
