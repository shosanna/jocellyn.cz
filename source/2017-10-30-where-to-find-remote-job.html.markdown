I was looking for a remote job for some time before I found my job at Leadfeeder. I knew I wanted to try remote since I read the book from 37signals - It was always my goal to have enough personal time to be with my family, to be able to take break whenever I want, to go walk my dogs in the middle of the day, to enjoy the sun, to work from our garden or from cozy coffee place … I also really liked the idea to split my working time into several smaller blocks, because I am completely unable to focus 8 hours straight. For all these reasons I believed remote could be something for me, even though I am social person who enjoys speaking with people a lot.

I was working for a big corporation with modern offices and classical 9-to-5 schedule once ... it had its own perks, but for me it was a productivity killer. I was wondering all the time how I could spend my time better, surrounded by people and things I actually like. I hated getting up in the morning and I hated that every day was the same. So I quit and started to look for my dream job.

In this article I want to share with you my sources of remote jobs with brief comments about them. I found it very valuable to know where to look. There are so many job opportunities out there, but sometimes they are well hidden. A year ago, if you would have asked me, I would say that finding a remote job is impossible. At least for someone like me, who just recently started and does not have 10 years of experience. I would not believe I can find a remote job. But I would have been wrong, I found a lots of possibilities. You just need to look and not give up.

Here is my list of sources (in no particular order):

- [https://landing.jobs/]()
All types of jobs, possible to filter remote
Something like an agency - they need to pre-approve you before it goes to the company
I thought it was very cool, with a personal touch, but they started to email me a lot and did not actually get me any interview

- [https://angel.co/]()
All types of jobs, possible to filter remote
Only startups Similar to Tinder - you just say interested or not interested (although lots of companies want more info)
This approach was not successful for me, almost no one replied back
Good filtering

- [https://remoteok.io/]()
Only remote jobs
No filtering, only tags
I did not like the UI, but the jobs were not that bad

- [https://weworkremotely.com/]()
Only remote jobs
No filtering, only search
My favourite site, except they are having tons of applicants (it is famous because of the book Remote)

- [http://stackoverflow.com/jobs]()
All types of jobs, possible to filter remote
Good filtering
This site ended up to be the most successful for me - almost every company I contacted there replied, I got several interviews through this site and landed my job at [https://www.leadfeeder.com/]()

- [https://www.workingnomads.co]()
Only remote jobs
No filtering, only tags
It seems like there are A LOT of jobs, not just tech

- [https://remotelist.io/]()
Only remote jobs
Yet another site with similar jobs like elsewhere

- [https://github.com/justshiv/remote-first]()
Only remote tech jobs
Someone’s personal list, it is very nice
I found it by accident :)

Besides that, in Czech republic environment, I really like those sites, even though they are not focused on remote, one can find there occasionally something interesting:

- [https://jobs.czechcrunch.cz/]()
It is new, there are not many offers yet, but I believe it has a potential

- [https://www.startupjobs.cz/]()
My favourite czech job portal, it should be only startups

- [https://techloop.io]()
Would have been my favourite portal at all, I love their idea of sharing salary information up front, I love how many companies are there and I love the bonus for getting job through them BUT
they are having too many technical issues all the time. I messaged their customer support dozens of times, because something in the UI just was not working :(


When I was looking for a job, I was checking all of those. I wanted a Ruby job, I wanted something which would seem friendly, but not too friendly (I hate companies who try to lure you in for free beer, xbox in the office or frequent pub visits ... I am not looking for a party job, I want a serious job I can be proud of). I wanted something which would attract the same type of person as I am - with focus on learning, improving, becoming a better developer. I also wanted a lot of freedom, nice salary and possibility to travel at least sometimes.

I can’t believe I found all of it and much more. I am so happy at Leadfeeder. I have been working there for 4 months now and I am pretty much sure it is place for me. I am constantly learning, I like the people I am working with and the processes here just make everything go smoothly and without stress. I hope for every Ruby developer out there, seeking remote job, to find something as good as I have (and you can always apply to us :).
